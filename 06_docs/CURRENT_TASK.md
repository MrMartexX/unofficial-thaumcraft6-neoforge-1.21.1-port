# Current task

Last updated: 2026-06-18

## Current branch

`main` is the active working branch.

## Current focus

- Keep build CI green.
- Use GitHub Actions build and dedicated server smoke testing only for relevant NeoForge port changes.
- Keep documentation and audit outputs organized under `06_docs/` and `tools/`.

## Recently confirmed

- GitHub Actions build workflow exists and runs on GitHub-hosted Windows runner.
- Build workflow is now path-filtered to `05_neoforge_port/**` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
- Dedicated server smoke test script exists under `tools/ci/server-smoke.ps1`.
- The active migration guide is now `06_docs/migration/NeoForge_legacy_migration_guide.md`; older `.docx` references were removed from current docs.
- The latest crucible recipe/page boundary batch passed build, server smoke, research page catalog audit, and Thaumonomicon protocol audit.

## Do not change without explicit request

- Do not move or delete large legacy/audit documents until references are checked and the move is recorded in `06_docs/documentation_index.md`.
- Do not treat `thaumcraft:crucible` recipe/page data as in-world crucible gameplay.
- Do not start in-world crucible, infusion, essentia transport, broad worldgen, or broad rendering systems without a focused design note and validation path.
- Do not commit generated local reports unless they are intentionally curated under `06_docs/audits/`.

## Near-term tasks

1. Continue recipe/page work by audited dependency family:
   - Current `thaumcraft:crucible` serializer/page-data boundary covers HEDGE_ALCHEMY, METAL_PURIFICATION, Alumentum, Nitor, Brass/Thaumium Ingots, and all vis-crystal recipes.
   - Do not treat this as in-world crucible gameplay.
   - Next safe batch should either classify/port another pure recipe-page family or start a focused in-world crucible/alchemy design slice before behavior.
   - Keep build, server smoke, page-catalog audit, and protocol audit green after the batch.
2. Keep bridge/placeholder outputs clearly marked as non-gameplay implementations until their subsystems exist.
3. Keep reusable audit scripts under `tools/audits/`.
4. Keep local/generated audit output under ignored `tools/reports/local/` or curate it into `06_docs/audits/` only when useful.

## CI smoke note

- Keep CI/server smoke strict for datapack/recipe/log-quality failures while avoiding false positives from DEBUG dependency names.

## CI smoke stale-lock note

- Server smoke should fail early on a locked local run/world/session.lock and print stale runServer process hints.

## CI smoke local cleanup note

- Local server smoke can be run with -KillStaleRunServer to clean up stale repo runServer Java or Gradle processes before testing.

## CI smoke clean-workspace note

- Server smoke pre-seeds run/server.properties so CI clean-workspace first startup does not create a benign Minecraft Settings ERROR.

## Custom recipe boundary note

- Use 06_docs/audits/custom_recipe_boundary_audit.md before implementing the next non-arcane custom recipe serializer/page/behavior slice.

## Research recipe page gap note

- Use 06_docs/audits/research_recipe_page_gap_audit.md to pick the next serializer/page implementation slice from actual stage/addendum recipe page gaps.

## Legacy alchemy recipe source note

- Use 06_docs/audits/legacy_alchemy_recipe_source_audit.md to choose the first alchemy/crucible/special recipe page serializer slice from legacy source evidence.

## Hedge alchemy recipe extraction note

- Use 06_docs/audits/hedge_alchemy_legacy_recipe_blocks.md as the source of truth for the first crucible recipe data/page boundary batch.

## Crucible recipe page boundary note

- Re-run research recipe page gap and page catalog audits after the HEDGE_ALCHEMY crucible recipe page boundary batch.

## Post-HEDGE audit refresh note

- Use refreshed post-HEDGE research_recipe_page_gap_audit.md counts to choose the next family-level recipe/page batch.

## Remaining alchemy recipe extraction note

- Use 06_docs/audits/remaining_alchemy_legacy_recipe_blocks.md to select the next remaining alchemy family-level recipe/page batch.

## Crucible aspect alias note

- Crucible recipe aspect costs now accept legacy Aspect enum aliases; keep generated crucible JSON in legacy-source terms when useful and let the serializer canonicalize.

## Metal purification crucible note

- Re-run recipe page gap and registry/tag audits after the METAL_PURIFICATION crucible recipe/page batch.

## Post-metal-purification audit note

- Use refreshed post-METAL_PURIFICATION audits to choose the next small pure crucible alchemy batch.

## Base alchemy/metallurgy crucible page note

- `thaumcraft:crucible` page-data now covers Alumentum, Nitor, Brass Ingot, Thaumium Ingot and 37 vis-crystal recipes.
- Current catalog audit result: `113 READY`, `86 DEFERRED`, `4 LEGACY_MISSING`.
- Current protocol audit result: `27/27`.
- In-world crucible behavior, special alchemy side effects, and crucible-derived aspect generation remain deferred.
## Special alchemy crucible page note

- Added special alchemy crucible recipe/page boundary entries for Bath Salts, Bottled Taint, Liquid Death, and Sane Soap.
- Keep their real gameplay/fluids/consumable behavior deferred; current scope is recipe identity and Thaumonomicon page availability.

## Post-metal-purification audit note

- Use refreshed post-SPECIAL_ALCHEMY audits to confirm whether ALCHEMY_CRUCIBLE_OR_SPECIAL_PAGE is closed before choosing the next batch.

## Golemancy boundary source audit note

- Use `06_docs/audits/golemancy_page_boundary_source_audit.md` before implementing GOLEMANCY_PAGE_DEFERRED references.
- Separate seal behavior placeholders, golem machine/block boundaries, and actual recipes into different batches.
